Bug #1
Date: 2021.03.21
Handler: Ma Zicheng
Detail: Although the initialization of PIC is properly set, the inb(keyboard_dataport)
        always passes in the same value of 124, no matter what key is pressed.
Solution: I wrongly distinguish the difference between IDT index and keyboard's dataport,
          so firstly the macro KEY_DATAPORT is set to 0x21, and after changing it to
          0x60, things weng right.
