Flow:

Bug #1
Date: 2021.03.21
Handler: Ma Zicheng
Detail: Although the initialization of PIC is properly set, the inb(keyboard_dataport)
        always passes in the same value of 124, no matter what key is pressed.
Solution: I wrongly distinguish the difference between IDT index and keyboard's dataport,
          so firstly the macro KEY_DATAPORT is set to 0x21, and after changing it to
          0x60, things weng right.

Bug #2
Date: 2021.03.21
Handler: Huang Tianhao
Detail: the table base address of the first PDE can not be correct assigned to the target 
        31-12bit in PDE
Solution: Because when we use 20 bit table base address, we would add 12 zero at right to 
          make it as 32-bit variable. Thus we need to shift to right 12 bits when we store it, then after adding 12 zero, the value of the first page table would be correct.

Bug #3
Date: 2021.3.22
Handler: Chen Yize
Detail: IDT, PIC and RTC are all normally initialized, but the PIC can not respond to any interrupt
        by providing corresponding handler, 
Solution:
